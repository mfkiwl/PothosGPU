Drop-in replacements for:
 * /comms/freq_demod

Short-term:
 * Rename/refactor some existing blocks to match /comms blocks
 * Alias /arrayfire/comms blocks to match ArrayFire function names
 * For PothosDoc parameters, put name in [] instead of () so it appears in diagram
 * Consistency in if strings are all upper-case or title-case
