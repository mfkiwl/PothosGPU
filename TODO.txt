Short-term:
 * For PothosDoc parameters, put name in [] instead of () so it appears in diagram
 * Consistency in if strings are all upper-case or title-case

Long-term:
 * Looks like we can't use underlying buffers, so analyze topology and generate single JIT block with corresponding ArrayFire calls?
