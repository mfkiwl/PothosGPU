Short-term:
 * AF 3.7+: turn off stacktraces for release build (not linking for some reason)
 * data: range (optionally tracking across multiple works), iota(?), join, shift, flip
 * signal: interp?
 * statistics: topk
 * For PothosDoc parameters, put name in [] instead of () so it appears in diagram
 * Consistency in if strings are all upper-case or title-case
 * Test pinned buffer manager that chooses own backend
