# ArrayFire Pothos Blocks

This toolkit adds 100+ Pothos blocks that wrap the majority of ArrayFire's API, as well as optimized reimplementations of existing blocks. This allows for more intensive processing to be offloaded onto a GPU, resulting in significant speed improvements.

**2020/03/11: This module currently depends on the master branch of the PothosCore repository. Pothos 0.7 will be the first stable release this module supports.**
